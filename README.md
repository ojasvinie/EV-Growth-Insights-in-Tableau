# EV-Growth-Insights-in-Tableau
I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze electric vehicle (EV) population data across the U.S., focusing on trends in vehicle adoption, types, and distribution. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total vehicles, BEV and PHEV counts, and average electric range. I used bar charts to visualize growth by model year and a map to show state-wise distribution, revealing Washington as the leading state. Additional charts display the top 10 vehicle makes, with Tesla accounting for over 50% of the total, and model-wise breakdowns showing Model Y and Model 3 as top choices. A donut chart illustrates Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, helping identify incentive-eligible EVs. I included filters for EV type, state, model, and eligibility status to allow interactive exploration. This project strengthened my ability to derive insights from large datasets and present them through clear, user-friendly visualizations using Tableau.
